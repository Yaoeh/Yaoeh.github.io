## Relevant Projects

I have done past projects in Revit, Unity, Maya, as well as Rhino. Additionally I have done projects on user interface design and sensors and signal processing. I also have developed software projects and systems that involve multiple languages/ interfaces, which could be relevant to the internship. I've compiled a list of relevant projects to demonstrate my skillset:

  * [Revit (Dynamo)](http://www-scf.usc.edu/~alanwang/revit.html){:target="_blank"} Not unlike Rhino, grasshopper, I have done projects to generate sheets as well as programmatically interoperate between Rhino and Revit.
  * [Unity (C#)](http://yaoeh.github.io/alanwang/portfolio/portfolio-2-game/){:target="_blank"} Published a handful of games. In relevance, knows about scene transitions, animation timeline, and serialization workflows.
  * [Maya (Python)](https://yaoeh.github.io/architecture/2014/07/12/functionless.html){:target="_blank"} Some experience with rigging, custom scripts.
  * [TI-Robotics-System-Learning-Kit (TIRSLK,C++)](https://github.com/yaoeh/FA19_ECE_TIRSLK_MAX){:target="_blank"} Finished a semester coursework on building a robot.

## Tertiary Skillset
* [Enterprise Network Design](http://www-scf.usc.edu/~alanwang/enterpriseNetworking.html){:target="_blank"} background could help with interfacing between software as well as computers in the network.
* [User Interface Design](https://www.behance.net/yaoeh){:target="_blank"} could be relevant to the proposed project.
