How do you stay happy during your PhD?

Or just in life in general? Recently, a friend of mine introduced me to the following equation:

Happiness = Reality - Expectation

It seems to make sense. When we reduce our expectations, we can be more easily happy with our current station in life. The first thing that people think then, however, is that this is also an equation for stagnation. If we are happy with where we are, we are probably more likely to not want to improve ourselves then?

I remember another conversation I had with a friend, about our growth being limited by our capacity for dissatisfaction. Using that conversation, I derived the following equation:

Improvement = Dissatisfaction - Reality

We only strive to make improvements when we are dissatisfied with our current reality, right? The more dissatisfied we are, the more we are driven to make changes. We stop making improvements when we are satisfied with our reality. But if that is the case, and we equate dissatisfaction with expectation, we get the following:

Happiness = - Improvement

Which is messed up! If we are only ever happy when we are not improving ourselves, constant improvement would mean being constantly unhappy!! The key in being happy and improving ourselves, then seems to be not equating dissatisfaction with expectations? If we can be dissatisfied with whatever we are currently, but never expect anything more than what we are now... maybe... maybe we'll be truly happy?
