Things I wish I knew about time management ten years ago.

I think one of my chief challenges during my education journey mainly dealt with not having enough time to tackle my interests.  It wasn't until I arrived at graduate school, however, that I was introduced to the quadrants of time management: I: (urgent, important), II: (not urgent, important), III: (urgent, not important), IV: (not urgent, not important).

At the first glance, it is obvious that anything we do in life can fall into these four categories, right? It also seemed obvious we should focus on important and urgent tasks, then work on tasks in the quadrant order, right? Not quite so. Upon reading Covey's book, "7 habits of highly effective people", I realized that he actually advocates focusing mainly on quadrant II tasks instead. Why? The short answer is that quadrant II tasks allow people to have more proactivity and flexibility when tackling their own priorities.
